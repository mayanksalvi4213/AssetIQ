Great! Here's what each table does in your Lab Configuration system:

📋 Table Breakdown
1. labs - Lab Basic Information
Purpose: Stores the basic information about each lab and its grid dimensions.

What it stores:

id (PK) - Unique identifier for each lab
lab_id - Lab reference code/number (e.g., "LAB309")
lab_name - Name of the lab (e.g., "Computer Lab 309")
rows - Number of rows in the seating grid (e.g., 6)
columns - Number of columns in the seating grid (e.g., 6)
Example: Lab 309 is a 6x6 grid computer lab

2. lab_stations - Individual Workstations/Seats
Purpose: Represents each physical workstation/seat in the lab grid. Each station can have multiple devices assigned to it.

What it stores:

station_id (PK) - Unique ID for each station
lab_id (FK) - Which lab this station belongs to
assigned_code - Unique code for the station (e.g., "apsit/it/309/1", "apsit/it/309/2")
row_number - Which row in the grid (0-based or 1-based)
column_number - Which column in the grid
created_at - When the station was created
Example: Station with code "apsit/it/309/1" is in Lab 309 at row 0, column 0

3. lab_station_devices - Devices Assigned to Each Station
Purpose: Links actual devices from the devices table to lab stations. This is where the PC, monitor, keyboard, etc. are connected to a specific workstation.

What it stores:

id (PK) - Unique record ID
station_id (FK) - Which station this device belongs to
device_id - Reference to the actual device in the devices table
device_type - Type of device (PC, Monitor, Keyboard, etc.)
brand, model, specification - Device details
invoice_number, bill_id (FK) - Procurement information
is_linked - Boolean: Is this device part of a linked group?
linked_group_id - Which linked group (1, 2, 3...) if applicable
created_at - Assignment timestamp
Example:

Station 1 has: PC (Dell, XPS), Monitor (Dell, 24"), Keyboard (Logitech)
All three have linked_group_id = 1 (they were linked together)
4. lab_grid_cells - Grid Layout Visual Representation
Purpose: Stores the visual/UI state of each cell in the lab grid layout. Tracks what's displayed and the OS configuration.

What it stores:

cell_id (PK) - Unique cell identifier
lab_id (FK) - Which lab this cell belongs to
row_number, column_number - Position in grid
assigned_code - Code displayed on this cell (e.g., "apsit/it/309/1")
equipment_type - What type is displayed (PC, Laptop, Empty, etc.)
os_windows, os_linux, os_other - Boolean flags for OS installed
is_empty - Is this cell empty or occupied?
station_id - Links to the station (if occupied)
created_at - Creation timestamp
UNIQUE constraint: (lab_id, row_number, column_number) - no duplicate cells
Example:

Cell at row 0, col 0 shows "apsit/it/309/1", has Windows + Linux installed, links to station_id 5
5. lab_equipment_pool - Equipment Available for Assignment
Purpose: Tracks all equipment that has been added to this lab from inventory (whether assigned to stations or still available). This is like your "Available Devices for Seating" list.

What it stores:

id (PK) - Unique record ID
lab_id (FK) - Which lab owns this equipment pool
equipment_type, brand, model, specification - Device details
quantity_added - Total devices added to this lab (e.g., 30 PCs)
quantity_assigned - How many are currently assigned to stations (e.g., 20)
invoice_number, bill_id (FK) - Procurement details
unit_price, purchase_date - Financial info
is_standby - Boolean: Is this excess/standby equipment from a linked group?
linked_group_id - Which linked group it belongs to (if any)
created_at - When added
Example:

Lab 309 has 30 Dell PCs added (invoice: inv420)
25 are assigned to stations, 5 are still available
Also has 5 standby monitors (excess from linked group 1)
🔄 How They Work Together
Scenario: Creating a 6x6 Lab with Linked Devices

labs: Create Lab 309 with 6 rows, 6 columns
lab_equipment_pool: Add 30 PCs, 30 Monitors, 30 Keyboards from inventory
User links devices → Creates linked_group_id = 1 (PC + Monitor + Keyboard)
User assigns 20 stations:
lab_stations: Creates 20 station records with codes "apsit/it/309/1" through "/20"
lab_station_devices: Creates 60 records (20 stations × 3 devices each)
lab_grid_cells: Creates cells for the 6x6 grid, 20 occupied, 16 empty
lab_equipment_pool: Updates quantity_assigned from 0 to 20 for PCs, Monitors, Keyboards
devices table: Updates assigned_code column for the 60 actual devices
🎯 Key Benefits
✅ Full history: Know exactly which devices are in each station
✅ Linking tracking: See which devices were linked together
✅ Availability: Know how many devices are still unassigned in the lab
✅ Grid visualization: Recreate the exact visual layout
✅ OS tracking: Know which OSes are installed on each station
✅ Future queries:

"Show all stations with Windows"
"Which devices are in Station 5?"
"How many PCs are still available in Lab 309?"
"Show me the full layout of Lab 309"
This structure gives you complete flexibility for managing, querying, and visualizing your lab configurations!
